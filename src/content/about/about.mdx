Hey, I’m Dan. I live in Bristol, UK and I’m a Software Engineer on the web team at [Sainsbury's](https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/).

I have a background in sales and consulting with prior clients  including FTSE100 and S&amp;P500 organisations including [Marsh](https://www.mmc.com/), [Chubb](https://www.chubb.com/uk-en/) and [Hiscox](https://www.hiscox.co.uk/).

Since requalifying, I've worked as a Software Engineer for 4+ years across Fintech, SaaS, Gaming and more recently eCommerce.
