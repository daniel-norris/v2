Hey, I’m Dan. I live in Bristol, UK and I’m a Software Engineer at [LexisNexis](https://risk.lexisnexis.co.uk/), a FTSE100 tech company based out of Cardiff.

I have a background and over 5 years experience as a Principal Technical Recruiter / Manager. Some of my clients have  included FTSE100 and S&amp;P500 organisations including [Marsh](https://www.mmc.com/), [Chubb](https://www.chubb.com/uk-en/) and [Hiscox](https://www.hiscox.co.uk/).

After graduating from a tech accelerator called [DevelopMe_](https://developme.tech/) in 2020, I requalified as a Software Engineer. I enjoy creating seamless end-to-end user experiences that add value.

In my free time you can find me rock climbing around local crags here in the UK and trying to tick off all the '4000er' peaks in the Alps.
