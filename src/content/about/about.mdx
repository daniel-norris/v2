Hey, I’m Dan. I live in Bristol, UK and I’m a Software Engineer at [Oddschecker](https://www.oddschecker.com/us/).

I have a background and over 5 years experience as a Principal Technical Recruiter and Manager. Some of my clients have included FTSE100 and S&amp;P500 organisations including [Marsh](https://www.mmc.com/), [Chubb](https://www.chubb.com/uk-en/) and [Hiscox](https://www.hiscox.co.uk/).

After deciding that I wanted to shift away from helping companies sell their tech enabled products and services and start building them myself, I graduating from a tech accelerator called *DevelopMe\_* in 2020 and requalified as a Software Engineer.
