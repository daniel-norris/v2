Originally migrated this client's web app from PHP in several days to Next.js 13 and Contentful CMS. Recently updated it to the app router on Next.js 14 and implemented a simple serverless backend in Node.js to handle enquiries and marketing mailing. Currently building a booking system and Stripe integration for recurring billing.
