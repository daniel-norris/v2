[[Live Demo](https://gatsby-portfolio-how-to.netlify.app/)]

Welcome to the second part of this two-part series on how to build your portfolio using Gatsby. Part 2 assumes you've gone through part 1, have built your portfolio and are now interested in taking a bit of a deeper dive into one way you could choose to build a blog with Gatsby using MDX.

If not, then take a look at part 1 [here](https://www.danielnorris.co.uk/blog/posts/how-to-build-a-portfolio-using-gatsby/).

# **Who is this for?**

This isn't a Gatsby starter, although you are welcome to use the GitHub repository as a starter for your own use.

If you do, please star the repository. This series is aimed at people who are interested in how to build their own Gatsby portfolio and blog from scratch without the aid of a starter.

# **What will this cover?**

We'll cover the following:

**Part 2**

- Why MDX?
- What are you going to build?
- Create a blog page
- Configure the Gatsby `filesystem` plugin
- Create your first MDX blog articles
- Create slugs for your MDX blog posts
- Programmatically create your MDX pages using the `createPages` API
- Create a blog post template
- Dynamically show article read times
- Make an index of blog posts
- Create a featured posts section
- Customise your MDX components
- Add syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Add a featured image to blog posts
- Add Google Analytics
- Summary

# Why MDX?

One of the major features about Gatsby is your ability to source content from nearly anywhere. The combination of GraphQL and Gatsby's source plugin ecosystem means that you could pull data from a headless CMS, database, API, JSON or without GraphQL at all. All with minimal configuration needed.

MDX enables you to write JSX into your Markdown. This allows you to write long-form content and re-use your React components like charts for instance to create some really engaging content for your users. I've included a quick example below using MDX in this article.

```jsx
## This is Markdown

<div style={{ padding: '20px', backgroundColor: 'skyblue' }}>
  <h3>This is JSX</h3>
</div>
```

## This is Markdown

<div style={{ padding: "20px", backgroundColor: "skyblue" }}>
  <h3>This is JSX</h3>
</div>

# What are you going to build?

There are a lot of starter templates that are accessible from the Gatsby website which enable you to get off the ground running with a ready-made blog or portfolio in a couple clicks. What that doesn't do is break down how it works and how you could make one yourself. If you're more interested in getting stuff done than how it works, then I recommend taking a look at the starters [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/?v=2).

You will have already created a basic portfolio in part 1 similar to the demo site available above. We're now going to create a blog for our portfolio that is programmatically created from MDX using GraphQL. We'll separate our blog into components; one section to display our featured articles and another to display an index of all of our articles. Then we'll add syntax highlighting for code blocks, read times for our users, a cover image for each post and Google Analytics.

# Create a blog page

Gatsby makes it incredibly easy to implement routing into your site. Any `.js` file found within `src/pages` will automatically generate its own page and the path for that page will match the file structure it's found in.

We're going to create a new `blog.js` page that will display a list of featured blog articles and a complete list of all of our blog articles.

```bash
touch src/pages/blog.js
```

Let's now import our `Layout.js` component we created in part 1 and enter some placeholder content for now.

```jsx
import React from "react"
import Layout from "../components/Layout"

export default ({ data }) => {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <h1>Blog</h1>
      <p>Our blog articles will go here!</p>
    </Layout>
  )
}
```

If you now navigate to [http://localhost:9090/blog](http://localhost:9090/blog) you'll be able to see your new blog page.

# Configure the Gatsby `filesystem` plugin

We want to colocate all of our long-form content together with their own assets, e.g. images, then we want to place them into a folder like `src/content/posts`. This isn't the `src/pages` directory we used early so we'll need to do a bit of extra work in order to dynamically generate our blog pages. We'll use Gatsby's `createPages` API to do this shortly.

Firstly, we need to configure the `gatsby-source-filesystem` plugin so that Gatsby knows where to source our MDX blog articles from. You should already have the plugin installed so let's configure it now. We'll add the location to our `gatsby-config.js` file.

```jsx
...

{
    resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
    options: {
        name: `posts`,
        path: `${__dirname}/src/content/posts`,
    },
},

...
```

Your full file should look something like this:

```jsx
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    `gatsby-plugin-postcss`,
    `gatsby-plugin-sharp`,
    `gatsby-transformer-sharp`,
    `gatsby-plugin-mdx`,
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        name: `content`,
        path: `${__dirname}/src/content`,
      },
    },
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        name: `posts`,
        path: `${__dirname}/src/content/posts`,
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

# Create your first MDX blog articles

Let's create several dummy articles for now. We'll create quite a few so that we can differentiate some of them into featured articles to display on our home page. There's a quick way to do that:

```bash
mkdir -p src/content/posts
touch src/content/posts/blog-{1,2,3}.mdx
```

We're adding a lot of additional `frontmatter` now which we will use at a later date. For the time being, leave the `cover` property empty.

`Frontmatter` is just metadata for your MDX. You can inject them later into your components using a GraphQL query and are just basic YAML. They need to be at the top of the file and between triple dashes.

```yaml

```

Now do the same thing for the other two blog articles we've created.

# Create slugs for your MDX blog posts

We now need to create slugs for each of our blog posts. We could do this manually by including a URL or path property to each of our blog posts `frontmatter` but we're going to set up our blog so that the paths are generated dynamically for us. We'll be using Gatsby's `onCreateNode` API for this.

Create a `gatsby-node.js` file in your root directory. This file is one of four main files that you can optionally choose to include in a Gatsby root directory that enables you to configure your site and control its behaviour. We've already used the `gatsby-browser.js` file to import Tailwind CSS directives and `gatsby-config.js` to control what plugins we are importing.

```bash
touch gatsby-node.js
```

Now copy the following into your `gatsby-node.js` file. This uses a helper function called `createFilePath` from the `gatsby-source-filesystem` plugin to provide the value of each of your `.mdx` blog post's file paths. The Gatsby `onCreateNode` API is then used to create a new GraphQL node with the key of `slug` and value of blog posts path, prefixed with anything you like - in this case its `/blog`.

```jsx
const { createFilePath } = require("gatsby-source-filesystem")

exports.onCreateNode = ({ node, actions, getNode }) => {
  const { createNodeField } = actions

  // only applies to mdx nodes
  if (node.internal.type === "Mdx") {
    const value = createFilePath({ node, getNode })

    createNodeField({
      // we're called the new node field 'slug'
      name: "slug",
      node,
      // you don't need a trailing / after blog as createFilePath will do this for you
      value: `/blog${value}`,
    })
  }
}
```

If you want to find out more about the `gatsby-source-filesystem` plugin then take a look at [this](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-filesystem/). Further information the `onCreateNode` API can be found [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/node-apis/#onCreateNode).

# Programmatically create your MDX pages using the `createPages` API

We're going to re-use some boilerplate from the Gatsby docs now and add the following code below to what we have already included in the previous section. This gets added to all of the existing node in the `gatsby-node.js` file. This uses the `slug` we created in the earlier section and Gatsby's `createPages` API to create pages for all of your `.mdx` files and wraps it in a template.

```jsx
const path = require("path")

exports.createPages = async ({ graphql, actions, reporter }) => {
  // Destructure the createPage function from the actions object
  const { createPage } = actions

  const result = await graphql(`
    query {
      allMdx {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            fields {
              slug
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `)

  // Create blog post pages.
  const posts = result.data.allMdx.edges

  // you'll call `createPage` for each result
  posts.forEach(({ node }, index) => {
    createPage({
      // This is the slug you created before
      path: node.fields.slug,
      // This component will wrap our MDX content
      component: path.resolve(`./src/templates/blogPost.js`),
      // You can use the values in this context in
      // our page layout component
      context: { id: node.id },
    })
  })
}
```

If you try and restart your development server, you'll receive an error to stay that your `blogPost.js` component doesn't exist. Let's create a template now to display all your blog posts.

# Create a blog post template

Let's firstly create a new `blogPost.js` template file.

```bash
touch src/templates/blogPost.js
```

Let's populate the template with some basic data such as title, date and body. We'll be dynamically adding read time, cover images and syntax highlighting shortly.

```jsx
import { MDXRenderer } from "gatsby-plugin-mdx"
import React from "react"
import Layout from "../components/layout"

export default ({ data }) => {
  const { frontmatter, body } = data.mdx

  return (
    <Layout>
      <section
        className="w-2/4 my-8 mx-auto container"
        style={{ minHeight: "80vh" }}
      >
        <h1 className="text-3xl sm:text-5xl font-bold">{frontmatter.title}</h1>
        <div className="flex justify-between">
          <p className="text-base text-gray-600">{frontmatter.date}</p>
        </div>

        <div className="mt-8 text-base font-light">
          <MDXRenderer>{body}</MDXRenderer>
        </div>
      </section>
    </Layout>
  )
}
```

Now we need to create a GraphQL query to populate the fields above.

```jsx
export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query BlogPostQuery($id: String) {
    mdx(id: { eq: $id }) {
      id
      body
      timeToRead
      frontmatter {
        title
        date(formatString: "Do MMM YYYY")
      }
    }
  }
`
```

We're passing an argument to this GraphQL query called `$id` here where we have made a type declaration that it is a `String`. We've passed this from the `context` object after using the `createPage` API in `gatsby-node.js` in the earlier section. Then we have filtered our GraphQL query to only return results that equal that `$id` variable.

If you now navigate to the url's below, each of your blog posts should now be working:

- Blog 1 ⇒ [http://localhost:9090/blog/posts/blog-1/](http://localhost:9090/blog/posts/blog-1/)
- Blog 2 ⇒ [http://localhost:9090/blog/posts/blog-2/](http://localhost:9090/blog/posts/blog-1/)
- Blog 3 ⇒ [http://localhost:9090/blog/posts/blog-3/](http://localhost:9090/blog/posts/blog-1/)

# Dynamically show article read times

Let's start to add a few more features to our blog post template. Something that you may regularly see on technical posts is the estimated time it takes to read the article. A great example of this on Dan Abramov's blog [overreacted.io](https://overreacted.io/).

There's an incredibly easy way to add this feature to your blog using Gatsby and GraphQL and it doesn't require you to write a function to calculate the length of your blog post. Let's add it now. Go back to your `blogPost.js` file and update your GraphQL query to also include the `timeToRead` property.

```jsx
export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query BlogPostQuery($id: String) {
    mdx(id: { eq: $id }) {
      id
      body
      timeToRead
      frontmatter {
        title
        date(formatString: "Do MMM YYYY")
      }
    }
  }
`
```

Now pass it as a prop and include it as an expression in your `blogPost.js` template.

```jsx
export default ({ data }) => {
	const { frontmatter, body, timeToRead } = data.mdx
	...
	<p className="text-base text-gray-600">{timeToRead} min read</p>
	...
}
```

If you refresh your development server, the read time for each particular blog post should now appear. Unless you included your own blog text, they should all read "1 min read" but try experimenting with longer articles and see it dynamically change.

# Make an index of blog posts

Our blog page is still looking a bit bare. Let's now populate it with a full list of all our blog posts. Let's firstly create a heading.

```jsx
import React from "react"
import Layout from "../components/Layout"

const Blog = ({ data }) => {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <section
        className="w-3/5 mx-auto container mt-6 flex flex-col justify-center"
        style={{ minHeight: "60vh" }}
      >
        <h1 className="text-3xl sm:text-5xl font-bold mb-6">Blog</h1>
        <p className="font-light text-base sm:text-lg">
          Arr aft topsail deadlights ho snow mutiny bowsprit long boat draft
          crow's nest strike colors bounty lad ballast.
        </p>
      </section>
      <p>List of blog articles goes here.</p>
    </Layout>
  )
}

export default Blog
```

Now let's create a GraphQL query that will return all `.mdx` files that have a file path that includes `posts/` and has a frontmatter property where the `published` value equals `true`.

We then want to sort the query in descending order so that the most recent article is displayed first. We can the pass this as a prop to a `Post` sub component we will create shortly, similar to what we have done with the `Hero`, `About` and other sub components we made in part 1.

```jsx
export const query = graphql`
  {
    posts: allMdx(
      filter: {
        fileAbsolutePath: { regex: "/posts/" }
        frontmatter: { published: { eq: true } }
      }
      sort: { order: DESC, fields: frontmatter___date }
    ) {
      edges {
        node {
          fields {
            slug
          }
          body
          timeToRead
          frontmatter {
            title
            date(formatString: "Do MMM")
          }
          id
          excerpt(pruneLength: 100)
        }
      }
    }
  }
`
```

Let's now create a new `Post.js` sub component.

```bash
touch src/components/Post.js
```

We can now iterate over the content prop in `Post.js` and create a list of all of our blog articles.

```bash
import React from 'react'
import { Link } from 'gatsby'

const Posts = ({ content }) => {
    return (
        <section
            id="blog"
            className="mt-6 flex flex-col mx-auto container w-3/5"
            style={{ marginBottom: '10rem' }}
        >
            <h3 className="text-3xl sm:text-5xl font-bold mb-6">All Posts</h3>

            {content.map((posts, key) => {
                const {
                    excerpt,
                    id,
                    body,
                    frontmatter,
                    timeToRead,
                    fields,
                } = posts.node

                return (
                    <Link to={fields.slug}>
                        <section
                            className="flex items-center justify-between mt-8"
                            key={id}
                        >
                            <div>
                                <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm font-bold text-gray-500">
                                    {frontmatter.date}
                                    <span className="sm:hidden">
                                        {' '}
                                        &bull; {timeToRead} min read
                                    </span>
                                </p>
                                <h1 className="text-lg sm:text-2xl font-bold">
                                    {frontmatter.title}
                                </h1>
                                <p className="text-sm sm:text-lg font-light">
                                    {excerpt}
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <p className="hidden sm:block text-sm font-bold text-gray-500">
                                {timeToRead} min read
                            </p>
                        </section>
                    </Link>
                )
            })}
        </section>
    )
}

export default Posts
```

Let's now go back to `blog.js` and replace the `<p>` element with the `Post.js` sub component and pass it the data object.

```jsx
import React from "react"
import { graphql, Link } from "gatsby"
import Layout from "../components/Layout"
import Post from "../components/Post"

const Blog = ({ data }) => {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <section
        className="w-3/5 mx-auto container mt-6 flex flex-col justify-center"
        style={{ minHeight: "60vh" }}
      >
        <h1 className="text-3xl sm:text-5xl font-bold mb-6">Blog</h1>
        <p className="font-light text-base sm:text-lg">
          Arr aft topsail deadlights ho snow mutiny bowsprit long boat draft
          crow's nest strike colors bounty lad ballast.
        </p>
      </section>
      <Post content={data.posts.edges} />
    </Layout>
  )
}

export default Blog

export const query = graphql`
  {
    posts: allMdx(
      filter: {
        fileAbsolutePath: { regex: "/posts/" }
        frontmatter: { published: { eq: true } }
      }
      sort: { order: DESC, fields: frontmatter___date }
    ) {
      edges {
        node {
          fields {
            slug
          }
          body
          timeToRead
          frontmatter {
            title
            date(formatString: "Do MMM")
          }
          id
          excerpt(pruneLength: 100)
        }
      }
    }
  }
`
```

If you navigate to [http://localhost:9090/blog](http://localhost:9090/blog) you should now see a list of all your available blog articles in descending order. Choosing whether you want to publicly display a blog article is as easy as changing the boolean value of published to `false` on that particular article's `frontmatter`.

# Create a featured posts section

We're going to create a featured posts section. Firstly, we'll create a new GraphQL query that enables us to filter only the posts that have a truthy `featured` frontmatter value.

Let's create that now and add it to our `blog.js` file.

```jsx
...
    featured: allMdx(
                filter: {
                    fileAbsolutePath: { regex: "/posts/" }
                    frontmatter: { published: { eq: true }, featured: { eq: true } }
                }
                sort: { order: DESC, fields: frontmatter___date }
            ) {
                edges {
                    node {
                        fields {
                            slug
                        }
                        frontmatter {
                            date(formatString: "Do MMM")
                            title
                        }
                        excerpt(pruneLength: 100)
                        id
                        body
                        timeToRead
                    }
                }
            }
...
```

Now, let's create a `FeaturedPosts.js` component.

```jsx
import React from "react"
import { Link } from "gatsby"

const FeaturedPosts = ({ content }) => {
  return (
    <section className="my-6 flex flex-col mx-auto container w-3/5">
      <h3 className="text-3xl sm:text-5xl font-bold mb-6">Featured Posts</h3>

      {content.map((featured, key) => {
        const {
          excerpt,
          id,
          body,
          frontmatter,
          timeToRead,
          fields,
        } = featured.node

        return (
          <Link to={fields.slug}>
            <section
              className="flex items-center justify-between mt-8"
              key={id}
            >
              <div>
                <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm font-bold text-gray-500">
                  {frontmatter.date}
                  <span className="sm:hidden">
                    {" "}
                    &bull; {timeToRead} min read
                  </span>
                </p>
                <h1 className="text-lg sm:text-2xl font-bold">
                  {frontmatter.title}
                </h1>
                <p className="text-sm sm:text-lg font-light">{excerpt}</p>
              </div>
              <p className="hidden sm:block text-sm font-bold text-gray-500">
                {timeToRead} min read
              </p>
            </section>
          </Link>
        )
      })}
    </section>
  )
}

export default FeaturedPosts
```

Let's now import the new component into `blog.js`.

```jsx
...
	const Blog = ({ data }) => {
	    return (
	        <Layout>
	            <section
	                className="w-3/5 mx-auto container mt-6 flex flex-col justify-center"
	                style={{ minHeight: '60vh' }}
	            >
	                <h1 className="text-3xl sm:text-5xl font-bold mb-6">Blog</h1>
	                <p className="font-light text-base sm:text-lg">
	                    Arr aft topsail deadlights ho snow mutiny bowsprit long boat
	                    draft crow's nest strike colors bounty lad ballast.
	                </p>
	            </section>
	            <FeaturedPost cta={false} content={data.featured.edges} />
	            <Post content={data.posts.edges} />
	        </Layout>
	    )
	}
...
```

Let's now re-use the `FeaturedPosts.js` component in our `index.js` page. You'll need to use the same GraphQL query again and pass it as a prop.

```jsx
...
	export default ({ data }) => {
	    return (
	        <Layout>
	            <Hero content={data.hero.edges} />
	            <About content={data.about.edges} />
	            <Project content={data.project.edges} />
	            <FeaturedPosts content={data.featured.edges} />
	            <Contact content={data.contact.edges} />
	        </Layout>
	    )
	}
...

	featured: allMdx(
	            filter: {
	                fileAbsolutePath: { regex: "/posts/" }
	                frontmatter: { published: { eq: true }, featured: { eq: true } }
	            }
	            sort: { order: DESC, fields: frontmatter___date }
	        ) {
	            edges {
	                node {
	                    fields {
	                        slug
	                    }
	                    frontmatter {
	                        date(formatString: "Do MMM")
	                        title
	                    }
	                    excerpt(pruneLength: 100)
	                    id
	                    body
	                    timeToRead
	                }
	            }
	        }
...
```

Let's add a call to action button for users who want to see the rest of our blog articles. We'll include this in our `FeaturedPosts.js` component and pass in a `boolean` prop to determine if we want to display the button or not.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Link } from 'gatsby'

const FeaturedPosts = ({ content, cta = true }) => {
    return (
       ...
            {!cta ? null : (
                <Link to="/blog" className="flex justify-center">
                    <button className="bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-400 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 border-b-4 border-red-700 hover:border-red-500 rounded mt-6">
                        See More
                    </button>
                </Link>
            )}
				...
    )
}

export default FeaturedPosts
```

Why don't we also double-check our GraphQL query is correctly displaying only the articles with a truthy `featured` frontmatter value. So, let's edit one of our blog articles, so that it does not display. Let's edit `blog-1.mdx`.

```jsx
---
title: Blog 1
subtitle: Blogging with MDX and Gatsby
date: 2020-08-18
published: true
featured: false
cover: ''
---

...
```

If you now navigate to [http://localhost:9090/](http://localhost:9090/) you'll see a featured posts section with just two articles displaying. When you navigate to [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090/)/blog you should now see a header, featured posts with two articles and all posts component displaying an index of all articles.

# Customise your MDX components

You may have noticed that we are having the same problem we encountered in part 1 with the markdown we are writing in our `.mdx` files. No styling is being applied. We could fix this by introducing some markup and include inline styles or Tailwind class names but we want to minimise the amount of time we need to spend writing a blog post.

So we'll re-iterate the process we used in part 1 and use the `MDXProvider` component to define styling manually for each markdown component.

```jsx
import { MDXRenderer } from "gatsby-plugin-mdx"
import { MDXProvider } from "@mdx-js/react"
import React from "react"
import Layout from "../components/Layout"

export default ({ data }) => {
  const { frontmatter, body, timeToRead } = data.mdx

  return (
    <MDXProvider
      components={{
        p: props => <p {...props} className="text-sm font-light mb-4" />,
        h1: props => (
          <h1 {...props} className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-10" />
        ),
        h2: props => <h2 {...props} className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8" />,
        h3: props => <h3 {...props} className="text-lg font-bold mb-4 mt-8" />,
        strong: props => (
          <strong
            {...props}
            className="font-bold"
            style={{ display: "inline" }}
          />
        ),
        a: props => (
          <a
            {...props}
            className="font-bold text-red-500 hover:underline cursor-pointer"
            style={{ display: "inline" }}
          />
        ),
        ul: props => (
          <ul {...props} className="list-disc font-light ml-8 mb-4" />
        ),
        blockquote: props => (
          <div
            {...props}
            role="alert"
            className="bg-red-100 border-l-4 border-red-500 text-red-700 p-4 ml-4 mb-4"
          />
        ),
      }}
    >
      <Layout>
        <section
          className="w-2/4 my-8 mx-auto container"
          style={{ minHeight: "80vh" }}
        >
          <h1 className="text-3xl sm:text-5xl font-bold">
            {frontmatter.title}
          </h1>
          <div className="flex justify-between">
            <p className="text-base text-gray-600">{frontmatter.date}</p>
            <p className="text-base text-gray-600">{timeToRead} min read</p>
          </div>
          <div className="mt-8 text-base font-light">
            <MDXRenderer>{body}</MDXRenderer>
          </div>
        </section>
      </Layout>
    </MDXProvider>
  )
}

export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query BlogPostQuery($id: String) {
    mdx(id: { eq: $id }) {
      id
      body
      timeToRead
      frontmatter {
        title
        date(formatString: "Do MMM YYYY")
      }
    }
  }
`
```

Now when you create a new blog post and write the long-form content using Markdown, the elements you've used will now display appropriately.

# Add syntax highlighting for code blocks

I'm trying to regularly use my blog to write technical articles and so I found adding syntax highlighting to code blocks made reading my articles a better experience for my users.

The process is a little involved but we'll try and break it down as best as possible. Firstly, we need to use the `gatsby-browser.js` API file to wrap our entire site with a plugin called `prism-react-renderer` that will enable us to use syntax highlighting on our code blocks in MDX.

Let's install the plugin firstly.

```bash
npm i prism-react-renderer
```

Now let's add in some boilerplate for the `gatsby-browser.js` file, for more information check out the API docs [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/browser-apis/#wrapRootElement).

```jsx
...

import React from 'react'
import { MDXProvider } from '@mdx-js/react'
import Highlight, { defaultProps } from 'prism-react-renderer'

const components = {
		...
}

export const wrapRootElement = ({ element }) => {
    return <MDXProvider components={components}>{element}</MDXProvider>
}
```

We've called the `wrapRootElement` function and returned our Gatsby site wrapped by `MDXProvider`. We're using the components prop and will be shortly passing a variable called `components` which will define a `Highlight` component imported form `prism-react-renderer`. This `MDXProvider` pattern is commonly known as a shortcode, you can find out more in the Gatsby docs [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/mdx/importing-and-using-components/).

If we navigate to the GitHub repository for the plugin, we're going to copy some of the example code and then make it fit for purpose for our blog. You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer).

```jsx
...

import React from 'react'
import { MDXProvider } from '@mdx-js/react'
import Highlight, { defaultProps } from 'prism-react-renderer'

const components = {
		pre: (props) => {
				return (
						<Highlight {...defaultProps} code={exampleCode} language="jsx">
					    {({ className, style, tokens, getLineProps, getTokenProps }) => (
					      <pre className={className} style={style}>
					        {tokens.map((line, i) => (
					          <div {...getLineProps({ line, key: i })}>
					            {line.map((token, key) => (
					              <span {...getTokenProps({ token, key })} />
					            ))}
					          </div>
					        ))}
					      </pre>
					    )}
					  </Highlight>,
				)
		}
}

export const wrapRootElement = ({ element }) => {
    return <MDXProvider components={components}>{element}</MDXProvider>
}
```

At the moment, the code block language is hard coded and we need to replace the `exampleCode` variable with the actual code we want to be highlighted. Let's do that now.

```jsx
...
        const components = {
        pre: (props) => {
            const className = props.children.props.className || ''
            const matches = className.match(/language-(?<lang>.*)/)

            return (
                <Highlight
                    {...defaultProps}
                    code={props.children.props.children.trim()}
                    language={
                        matches && matches.groups && matches.groups.lang
                            ? matches.groups.lang
                            : ''
                    }
                >
                    {({
                        className,
                        style,
                        tokens,
                        getLineProps,
                        getTokenProps,
                    }) => (
                        <pre className={className} style={style}>
                            {tokens.map((line, i) => (
                                <div {...getLineProps({ line, key: i })}>
                                    {line.map((token, key) => (
                                        <span {...getTokenProps({ token, key })} />
                                    ))}
                                </div>
                            ))}
                        </pre>
                    )}
                </Highlight>
            )
        },
    }
...
```

If you now edit one of your `.mdx` blog posts and include a code block using Markdown syntax, it should now be highlighted using `prism-react-renderer`'s default theme.

The padding is a little off, so let's fix that now.

```jsx
...
    <pre className={`${className} p-4 rounded`} style={style}>
        {tokens.map((line, i) => (
            <div {...getLineProps({ line, key: i })}>
                {line.map((token, key) => (
                    <span {...getTokenProps({ token, key })} />
                ))}
            </div>
        ))}
    </pre>
...
```

If you want to change the default theme, you can import it from `prism-react-renderer` and pass it as a prop to the `Highlight` component. You can find more themes [here](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes). I've decided to use the `vsDark` theme in our example. Your final `gatsby-browser.js` should look something like this.

```jsx
import "./src/css/index.css"
import React from "react"
import { MDXProvider } from "@mdx-js/react"
import theme from "prism-react-renderer/themes/vsDark"
import Highlight, { defaultProps } from "prism-react-renderer"

const components = {
  pre: props => {
    const className = props.children.props.className || ""
    const matches = className.match(/language-(?<lang>.*)/)

    return (
      <Highlight
        {...defaultProps}
        code={props.children.props.children.trim()}
        language={
          matches && matches.groups && matches.groups.lang
            ? matches.groups.lang
            : ""
        }
        theme={theme}
      >
        {({ className, style, tokens, getLineProps, getTokenProps }) => (
          <pre className={`${className} p-4 rounded`} style={style}>
            {tokens.map((line, i) => (
              <div {...getLineProps({ line, key: i })}>
                {line.map((token, key) => (
                  <span {...getTokenProps({ token, key })} />
                ))}
              </div>
            ))}
          </pre>
        )}
      </Highlight>
    )
  },
}

export const wrapRootElement = ({ element }) => {
  return <MDXProvider components={components}>{element}</MDXProvider>
}
```

# Add a featured image to blog posts

One of the last things we're going to do is provide the opportunity to add a featured image to each of our blog posts.

Let's firstly install a number of packages we're going to need.

```jsx
npm i gatsby-transformer-sharp gatsby-plugin-sharp gatsby-remark-images gatsby-image
```

Now we need to configure the plugins, let's update our `gatsby-config.js` file with the following:

```jsx
...
    {
        resolve: `gatsby-plugin-mdx`,
        options: {
            extensions: [`.mdx`, `.md`],
            gatsbyRemarkPlugins: [
                {
                    resolve: `gatsby-remark-images`,
                },
            ],
            plugins: [
                {
                    resolve: `gatsby-remark-images`,
                },
            ],
        },
    },
...
```

We now need to update our GraphQL query on `blogPost.js` so that it returns the image we'll be including in our blog posts frontmatter shortly. We're using a query fragment here to return a traced SVG image while our image is lazy-loading. More information on query fragment's and the Gatsby image API can be found [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-image/#about-tracedsvg).

```jsx
export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query BlogPostQuery($id: String) {
    mdx(id: { eq: $id }) {
      id
      body
      timeToRead
      frontmatter {
        title
        date(formatString: "Do MMM YYYY")
        cover {
          childImageSharp {
            fluid(traceSVG: { color: "#F56565" }) {
              ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid_tracedSVG
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
`
```

Let's now add an image to our `src/content/posts` folder. I've included one in the GitHub repository for this project but you can access a lot of open licence images from places like [https://unsplash.com/](https://unsplash.com/).

Include the location of the image into your blog posts frontmatter.

```jsx
---
title: Blog 3
subtitle: Blogging with MDX and Gatsby
date: 2020-08-31
published: true
featured: true
cover: './splash.jpg'
---
```

Now let's add it to the `blogPost.js` template. You'll need to import the `Img` component from `gatsby-image`.

```jsx
...
import Img from 'gatsby-image'

export default ({ data }) => {
    const { frontmatter, body, timeToRead } = data.mdx

    return (
        <MDXProvider
            components={{
                p: (props) => (
                    <p {...props} className="text-sm font-light mb-4" />
                ),
                h1: (props) => (
                    <h1 {...props} className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-10" />
                ),
                h2: (props) => (
                    <h2 {...props} className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8" />

# Add Google Analytics

This is a great way to monitor traffic to your site and on your blog posts. It also enables to you see where your traffic is coming from. Google Analytics is free up to c. 10 million hits per month per ID. I don't know about you but I'm not expecting that kind of traffic on my site, if you are then you may want to consider looking at the pricing options to avoid your service getting suspended.

First of all you want to sign up and get a Google Analytics account. You can do that with your normal Google account [here](https://analytics.google.com/).

Once you've set up an account, you'll be prompted to create a new property which is equivalent to your new website. You'll need to include your site's name and URL at this point which means you will have had to already deployed your site in part 1 - if you haven't you can follow the steps to do that [here](https://www.danielnorris.co.uk/blog/posts/how-to-build-a-portfolio-using-gatsby/).

Once you have created a new "property" you can access your tracking code by navigating to `Admin > Tracking Info > Tracking Code`. The code will be a number similar to `UA-XXXXXXXXX-X`.

Now that you have your tracking code, let's install the Google Analytics plugin for Gatsby.

```bash
npm i gatsby-plugin-google-analytics
```

Now, all you need to do it update your `gatsby-config.js` file.

```jsx
...
    {
            resolve: `gatsby-plugin-google-analytics`,
            options: {
            // replace "UA-XXXXXXXXX-X" with your own Tracking ID
            trackingId: "UA-XXXXXXXXX-X",
            },
    },
...
```

It can occasionally take a bit of time for statistics on Google Analytics to populate but you should start to see user data shortly after following the instructions above and deploying your site.

# Summary

That's it! 🎉

You should now have a fully functioning portfolio and blog that you have created from scratch using Gatsby, Tailwind CSS and Framer.

The site should be set up a way that enables you to update project work you have created, create a new blog post or update your social media links all from a single `.mdx` or config file. Making the time and effort required for you to now update your portfolio as minimal as possible.
